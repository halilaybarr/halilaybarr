Hiring Manager
[Company Name]

Hello [Name/Team],

I'm a full‑stack developer who ships production web apps with JavaScript, React, Node/Express, MongoDB, and REST APIs. Recently, I built and deployed WTWR (What to Wear?), a React + Express/MongoDB app with JWT‑protected routes, profile editing, and a weather‑driven UI:

- Live app: https://wtwrhalil.jumpingcrab.com
- API: https://api.wtwrhalil.jumpingcrab.com
- Code: https://github.com/halilaybarr

I'm excited about [Company/Team] because [one sentence aligning with their product/stack]. I can contribute immediately on [frontend/backend/full‑stack] work: clean components, API endpoints/controllers, Mongoose models, and auth/validation.

If helpful, I can complete a small task or PR aligned with your codebase. Thank you for your time—I'd welcome a quick chat.

Best,
Halil Aybar
